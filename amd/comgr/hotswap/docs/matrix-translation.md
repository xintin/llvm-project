## 1. Problem in one paragraph

gfx1250 matrix ops (WMMA) are **wave32 collectives**: 32 lanes
cooperate to compute a 16×16 output tile, each lane holding 8
fragment elements. gfx950 matrix ops (MFMA) are **wave64
collectives**: 64 lanes cooperate to compute the same-or-larger
tile, each lane holding 4 fragment elements. Three simultaneous
mismatches make simple intrinsic substitution impossible:

1. **Wave size.** The SPE projection runs the wave32 source kernel
   as two independent copies inside a wave64 (lanes 0..31 and
   lanes 32..63). An MFMA intrinsic naïvely placed in the IR
   couples those two copies — they become one matmul that mixes
   unrelated data.
2. **Fragment layout.** WMMA's lane-to-(row, col, k) mapping differs
   from MFMA's. The 256 output elements of a 16×16 tile land on
   different lanes after each primitive, so we cannot read-after-
   write directly between them.
3. **K-shape.** Some gfx950 MFMA shapes have a larger K than their
   gfx1250 WMMA counterpart (16×16×128 F8 MFMA vs. 16×16×64 F8 WMMA),
   which turns "replace WMMA with MFMA" into "fuse two WMMAs per
   MFMA" — a non-local rewrite.

The translation has to simultaneously (a) keep the two wave32
projections disjoint, (b) bridge the fragment layouts at the
boundary between source-visible VGPRs and the MFMA call, and (c)
handle K asymmetry. §3–§6 derive the general framework; §7 applies
it to MXFP; §8–§9 set the gates.

## 2. Why the baseline lowering works

`wmma_lowering.cpp` is the reference implementation. Its three
structural choices are reusable for every shape we add:

1. **Two-pass runGroupPass.** One pass lanes-0..31 drives the MFMA,
   one pass lanes-32..63 drives it. Each pass uses `ds_bpermute` to
   gather the wave32 group's operand fragments into the MFMA
   layout; MFMA runs on all 64 lanes but only its "owning" group's
   result is selected at the end. The top/bottom halves do not
   share matmul inputs across the boundary — they are two
   independent matmuls per source WMMA.
2. **ds_bpermute for layout bridging.** Reading from any lane
   regardless of EXEC, independent of the SPE predication story.
   Every fragment-layout translation reduces to a set of
   `ds_bpermute` calls plus a small `select` tree keyed on
   `laneId / 16` (the MFMA's lane-group ID).
3. **K-decomposition loop.** WMMA at K=32 unrolls into 2×MFMA at
   K=16 with accumulator chaining. The same structure generalises
   to K=N → (N/K_mfma)× MFMAs.

Cost per source WMMA: roughly `2 × (|A dwords| + |B dwords| + |C
dwords| + K/K_mfma) × ds_bpermute + 2 × K/K_mfma × MFMA +
|D dwords| × ds_bpermute`. For F16 16×16×32 this is ~116
ds_bpermute + 4 MFMAs. Matmul-bound kernels eat the overhead;
dot-product / reduction-over-matmul does not. That is a performance
consideration (out of scope for this doc); the policy here is
**correct output at any cost**.

## 3. Source model — gfx1250 WMMA / SWMMAC shapes

Captured corpus — the shapes we need to cover for GPT-OSS + Gluon:

| Shape | A dtype | B dtype | Out dtype | M×N×K | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16` | F16 | F16 | F32 | 16×16×32 | F16 GEMM, F16 FA |
| `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_bf16` | BF16 | BF16 | F32 | 16×16×32 | F16 GEMM (BF16 mode) |
| `v_wmma_i32_16x16x32_iu8` | I8 | I8 | I32 | 16×16×32 | (not in captured corpus, listed for completeness) |
| `v_wmma_f32_16x16x64_f8f6f4` | FP8/BF8/FP4 | same | F32 | 16×16×64 | MXFP GEMM, MXFP FA (via `wmma_scaled`) |
| `v_swmmac_f32_16x16x32_f16` | F16 | F16 (2:4 sparse) | F32 | 16×16×32 | Not observed; listed for refusal |

Only the first is today wired in `handle_valu_vop3p.cpp:145`; the
others exist in captured binaries we have not yet raised end-to-end.

Per-lane fragment sizes on gfx1250 (from AMD Matrix Instruction
Calculator):

| Shape | A VGPRs | B VGPRs | C/D VGPRs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16×16×32 F16 | 8 (v16f16) | 8 (v16f16) | 8 (v8f32) |
| 16×16×32 BF16 | 8 (v16bf16) | 8 (v16bf16) | 8 (v8f32) |
| 16×16×32 IU8 | 8 (v16i8) | 8 (v16i8) | 8 (v8i32) |
| 16×16×64 F8F6F4 | 16 for FP8/BF8, 12 for FP6/BF6, 8 for FP4 | same | 8 (v8f32) |

SWMMAC adds a 4×packed-per-lane sparsity mask. Deferred (§8).

## 4. Target model — gfx950 MFMA / scaled MFMA shapes

Relevant gfx950 shapes (from `semop.hpp:213-241`; AMD ISA reference
chapter 14):

| Shape | A dtype | Out dtype | M×N×K | Per-lane A/B/C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x32_F16` | F16 | F32 | 16×16×32 | 4 (v4f16)/4/4 |
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x16_F16` | F16 | F32 | 16×16×16 | 2/2/4 |
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x32_BF16` | BF16 | F32 | 16×16×32 | 4/4/4 |
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x16_BF16_1K` | BF16 | F32 | 16×16×16 | 2/2/4 |
| `V_MFMA_I32_16x16x32_I8` | I8 | I32 | 16×16×32 | 4/4/4 |
| `V_MFMA_I32_16x16x16_I8` | I8 | I32 | 16×16×16 | 1/1/4 (packed) |
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x32_FP8_FP8` | FP8 | F32 | 16×16×32 | 4/4/4 |
| `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x32_BF8_BF8` | BF8 | F32 | 16×16×32 | 4/4/4 |
| `V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_16x16x128_F8F6F4` | FP8/BF8/FP6/BF6/FP4 (per-block scaled) | F32 | 16×16×128 | varies/varies/4 |
| `V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_32x32x64_F8F6F4` | same | F32 | 32×32×64 | 4 |

Key asymmetries vs. source:

- **Direct K match** for 16×16×32 F16/BF16/I8 → 1 MFMA per WMMA
  (modulo fragment-layout bridge).
- **K larger on target** for F8F6F4 — one
  `MFMA_SCALE_F32_16x16x128` covers 2 source `WMMA_16x16x64_F8F6F4`.
  Two adjacent WMMAs in a K-loop **must fuse** into one MFMA on
  target, or we emit half of a partial sum, which is semantically
  wrong.
- **No gfx950 SWMMAC** — 2:4 sparsity has no direct MFMA
  equivalent. Refuse.

## 5. Per-shape translation templates

### 5.0 Target-capability dispatch (native vs. decompose)

Every matrix SemOp has a target-capability precondition that selects
between two handler paths:

1. **Native path.** Target ISA exposes an LLVM intrinsic with the same
   fragment shape → emit the intrinsic directly. No `ds_bpermute`, no
   K-decomposition, no two-pass redistribution. This is the right answer
   for every same-family retargeting (gfx1251 → gfx1250, gfx1250 →
   gfx1251, gfx942 → gfx942) and for any future target that gains WMMA
   with the same shape.
2. **Decompose path.** Target lacks the shape → run one of the
   templates below (§5.1–§5.3).

The existing F16 handler already implements this for WMMA vs. MFMA:

```157:170:amd/comgr/hotswap/handle_valu_vop3p.cpp
    Value *result_val;
    if (ctx.targetIsa.hasWMMA12) {
      Function *wmmaFn = Intrinsic::getOrInsertDeclaration(
          &ctx.M, Intrinsic::amdgcn_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16,
          {v8f32Ty, v16f16Ty});
      result_val = ctx.B.CreateCall(wmmaFn, {
          ctx.B.getFalse(), a,
          ctx.B.getFalse(), b,
          ConstantInt::get(Type::getInt16Ty(ctx.C), 0), c,
          ctx.B.getFalse(), ctx.B.getFalse()
      }, "wmma");
    } else {
      result_val = emitWMMAtoMFMA(ctx, a, b, c);
    }
```

Each new shape added in §5.1–§5.3 generalises this branch: the native
path is just one `Intrinsic::getOrInsertDeclaration` + call when the
target capability bit is set; the decompose path is the template body.

#### 5.0.1 Capability bits per shape family

The dispatch key is a per-shape capability table, not a single
generation check. Extend `ISAProfile` with one bit per shape family so
`handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` branches on a flag, not a target triple:

| Source SemOp family | Native on target iff | Decompose template | Introduced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `V_WMMA_F32_16x16x32_F16/BF16` | `targetIsa.hasWMMA12` (existing; `FeatureWMMA128bInsts`) | Template A (§5.1) | gfx12 (gfx1100+) |
| `V_WMMA_I32_16x16x32_IU8` | `targetIsa.hasWMMA12` | Template A | gfx12 |
| `V_WMMA_F32_16x16x64_F8F6F4` | `targetIsa.hasWMMA1250` (new; `FeatureGFX1250Insts`) | Template B (§5.2) onto `V_MFMA_F32_16x16x128_F8F6F4` when `targetIsa.hasMFMA` | gfx1250 |
| `V_WMMA_SCALED_F32_16x16x64_F8F6F4` | `targetIsa.hasWMMA1250` | Template C (§5.3) onto `V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_16x16x128_F8F6F4` when `targetIsa.hasScaledMFMA` | gfx1250 |
| `V_SWMMAC_F32_16x16x32_F16` | target has SWMMAC (no AMD target does today) | — (refuse, §R2) | gfx1250 |

The names line up with the TableGen `SubtargetFeature` definitions
(`FeatureWMMA128bInsts`, `FeatureGFX1250Insts`, etc.) so `ISAProfile::
fromSubtarget` stays a one-line read from `MCSubtargetInfo::hasFeature`
per bit.

`hasScaledMFMA` is a new bit for gfx950's `V_MFMA_SCALE_*` family. On
gfx942 it is false → Template C refuses (no software dequant fallback
per §5.4). On gfx1250 it is false too (native `V_WMMA_SCALED` is the
intended path) → use the native path above.

#### 5.0.2 Identity and same-family translation

When the source and target flags coincide for a given SemOp the native
path is always taken. Consequences:

- **gfx1251 → gfx1250** (same family, both have `hasWMMA12` and
  `hasWMMA1250`): every WMMA, including scaled, becomes a native WMMA
  intrinsic. No `ds_bpermute`, no K-doubling fuse, no fragment-layout
  tables consulted. Template A/B/C code is completely bypassed. The
  only remaining cost on this path is the LLVM IR roundtrip — which
  we already pay for the rest of the kernel.
- **Identity (gfx1250 → gfx1250)** is a degenerate same-family case
  and trivially uses the native path.

This is the concrete argument that a separate "fast code path" for
same-family translation is unnecessary: the capability branch above is
**the** fast path. It preserves the compiler's shape decisions exactly
because the intrinsic signature matches the source opcode.

#### 5.0.3 Relationship to the shape-registration gate (§G1)

`verifyMatrixShapeCoverage` (§G1) enforces that every WMMA SemOp has a
registered shape descriptor. This subsection adds the second column to
that table: for each `(sourceSemOp, targetIsa)` pair, exactly one of
{native intrinsic name, decompose template id, `refuse(reason)`} is
declared. The startup verifier fails loud if any row is missing. No
handler is allowed to pick between paths implicitly — the decision is
data, driven by the registered capability columns.

### 5.1 Template A: 1-to-1 K match, layout bridge only

Applies when the gfx950 shape has the same K as the gfx1250 shape
and the same M×N. **One MFMA per WMMA** via the two-pass pattern of
§2, with shape-specific dtype and fragment-size wiring.

```
emit<ShapeX>WMMAtoMFMA(ctx, a, b, c):
  aDwords[N_a] ← unpack(a)
  bDwords[N_b] ← unpack(b)
  cDwords[N_c] ← unpack(c)
  laneId ← emitLaneId()
  for groupBase in {0, 32}:
    mfmaA, mfmaB ← redistributeInput<ShapeX>(aDwords, bDwords,
                                             lane-group mapping for ShapeX,
                                             groupBase)
    mfmaC       ← redistributeAcc<ShapeX>(cDwords, groupBase)
    result      ← mfma<ShapeX>(mfmaA, mfmaB, mfmaC)
  resultDwords ← collectResult<ShapeX>(result0, result1, laneId)
  return pack(resultDwords)
```

The per-shape work is (a) the dtype tables for pack/unpack, (b) the
lane-group → WMMA-GPR index mapping inside `redistributeInput`, (c)
the `redistributeAcc` mapping, (d) the `collectResult` mapping, and
(e) the MFMA intrinsic ID.

**In-scope for T1-T3 below:** F16, BF16, I8 at 16×16×32. Each is
~150 LoC plus a per-shape lookup table, factored against the F16
baseline.

### 5.2 Template B: K-doubling fuse

Applies when gfx950's K is a multiple of gfx1250's K. Two adjacent
source WMMAs in the accumulator dependence chain must fuse into one
MFMA. Correct if and only if:

1. The two source WMMAs share the same accumulator C.
2. The two source WMMAs' operands are consecutive along K (A0
   covers K[0..31], A1 covers K[32..63], …).
3. No side effect (store, atomic, cross-lane) separates them.

Detection is a peephole over the instruction stream at raise time:
find pairs `wmma_{16x16x64}_f8f6f4(a0, b0, c0) → c1` followed
immediately by `wmma_{16x16x64}_f8f6f4(a1, b1, c1) → c2` where the
chain register matches. Fuse into one `mfma_{16x16x128}_f8f6f4` with
operands concatenated.

If the pair does not match, we have one WMMA that does not fuse.
Two options:

- (a) Refuse. Safest.
- (b) Emit a half-width MFMA by zero-padding the second operand.
  Semantically correct but costs 2× flops.

**Policy:** (a) refuse for the initial implementation. Expose a
`Shape` attribute whose canonical form demands a fuse-partner; if
none is found, refuse with `matrixShapeUnfusible`. Move to (b) only
when a real kernel demands it.

### 5.3 Template C: Scaled MFMA

Applies to `wmma_scaled` (MXFP) → `mfma_scale_*`. Structurally the
same as Template B (K-doubling fuse for the F8F6F4 shapes), with
two additional input streams — per-block scale values for A and B.

The Gluon `wmma_scaled` carries:
- `A_q` quantised tensor (FP8/FP4 etc.)
- `A_scale` per-block scale (one E8M0 per 32-element block)
- `B_q`, `B_scale`
- `dtype_a`, `dtype_b` metadata selecting the encoding

The gfx950 `V_MFMA_SCALE_F32_16x16x128_F8F6F4` has matching
operands: A, B, C, and a per-block scale carried in an extra SGPR
operand. The scale format (E8M0) is identical between architectures
— no dequantisation is required.

The translation:

1. Fuse the pair of source WMMA_scaled calls per §5.2.
2. Redistribute A, B, C fragments as in Template A.
3. Redistribute the scale fragments (new — their lane layout is
   defined in the ISA reference chapter 14.x). Scales live in VGPRs
   on both ISAs but with different per-lane packing.
4. Emit the scaled MFMA intrinsic
   (`@llvm.amdgcn.mfma.scale.f32.16x16x128.f8f6f4`).

**The scale-layout redistribution is the one new mechanical piece
beyond Template B.** It is the same family of `ds_bpermute + lane-
group select` code, just on a different per-lane width.

### 5.4 Template D (rejected): software dequant + dense MFMA

A fallback option that dequantises FP8/FP4 to F16 in-place and runs
dense F16 MFMA. Correct, slow (~30× overhead), and conceptually
defeats the purpose of MXFP. Rejected per the "no fallback" policy.
If Template C refuses, we refuse the kernel.

**Scope note — distinguishing rejected-Template-D from the landed
§7.4 ISA-level dequant lift.** The Template-D rejection above is
scoped to *synthesis*: the raiser must not choose dequant-then-dense-
matmul as an automatic fallback for a scaled WMMA/MFMA shape Template
C refuses. §7.4 (`v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4` cross-target lift) is a
different axis: when the *source* kernel itself already emits the
gfx1250 ISA-level dequant primitive (Triton's `tl.dot_scaled` on
gfx1250 does this before a dense BF16 WMMA), faithfully lifting that
primitive across targets is an individual-instruction lowering, not a
Template-D synthesis. The bit-exactness discipline in §7.4 (refuse
loudly on any input shape we can't prove bit-identical to the
hardware primitive) is precisely what separates a faithful lift from
a Template-D fallback. If the source emits it, we lift it; we do not
synthesise it.

## 6. Fragment-layout tables

The per-shape redistribution tables are **data**, not code. They
live in a new file `wmma_fragment_layouts.hpp`:

```cpp
struct FragmentLayout {
  // Source WMMA layout: for each source VGPR index g,
  // what (lane, k_or_row, m_or_col) does it hold?
  // Encoded as a table indexed by (shape, operand, gpr, lane).
  // Generated from AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator outputs.
  ...
};
```

The `wmma_lowering.cpp` comment block (lines 22-54) is the hand-
extracted table for F16 16×16×32. Generating all shapes mechanically
from the AMD tools avoids per-shape off-by-one bugs. **Do not
reverse-engineer by inspection.**

## 7. MXFP path, end to end

### 7.1 Source intent (Gluon)

```python
acc = gl.amd.gfx1250.wmma_scaled(a_q, a_scale, "e4m3",
                                 b_q, b_scale, "e4m3", acc)
```

Compiles to:

```asm
v_wmma_scaled_f32_16x16x64_f8f6f4  vD, vA_q, vB_q, vA_scale, vB_scale, vC
```

(No SemOp yet; today's raiser refuses the kernel at decode.)

### 7.2 Target shape

`v_mfma_scale_f32_16x16x128_f8f6f4`. K=128, so two adjacent source
WMMAs (K=64 each) fuse into one target MFMA. Scale granularity is
per 32-element block; K=128 holds 4 scale blocks per operand.

### 7.3 Refusal criteria

| Source pattern | Policy |
|---|---|
| `wmma_scaled` with unfusible neighbour | Refuse (`matrixShapeUnfusible`) |
| `wmma_scaled` with mixed dtype pair not in target's F8F6F4 table | Refuse (`mixedDtypeUnsupported`) |
| Per-block scale block size ≠ 32 | Refuse (current target only supports 32) |
| `wmma_scaled` output to non-F32 | Refuse (both platforms are F32-only here) |

### 7.4 ISA-level MXFP4 dequant primitive — `v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4`

> **Status:** cross-target lift landed. `scale_sel == 0` bit-exact on
> gfx1250 → gfx942/gfx950; `scale_sel != 0` refuses loudly until the
> 4-bit field's semantics are pinned in-tree. This subsection is
> additive to §7.1–§7.3 (the Gluon `wmma_scaled` path); the two
> surfaces are orthogonal (see §5.4's scope note).

#### What it is

`v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4` (VOP3 opcode 0x2a0 on gfx1250;
`VOP3Instructions.td:1873`) is an ISA-level primitive that converts a
single VGPR holding 8 packed FP4 E2M1 nibbles into 4 consecutive
VGPRs holding 8 BF16 values, applying a single E8M0 byte scale
selected from the 4 bytes of a second VGPR via the 4-bit `scale_sel`
immarg.

Operand layout (handler reads via `AMDGPU::getNamedOperandIdx` +
`OpName::scale_sel` — NOT by operand-index position, to survive a
future operand-table reorder):

| MC index | Operand | Width | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `vdst` | 128 bits (4 VGPRs) | `<8 x bfloat>` result |
| 1 | `src0` | 32 bits (1 VGPR) | packed-8 FP4; nibble 0 = lane 0, low nibble |
| 2 | `src1` | 32 bits (1 VGPR) | 4 E8M0 scale bytes |
| 3 | `scale_sel` | 4-bit ImmArg | byte-selector over `src1` |

The LLVM intrinsic
(`int_amdgcn_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4`, `IntrinsicsAMDGPU.td:688`,
gated by `isGFX125xOnly`) maps 1:1 to the MC instruction:

```
declare <8 x bfloat> @llvm.amdgcn.cvt.scale.pk8.bf16.fp4(
    i32 %src, i32 %scale, i32 immarg %scale_sel)
; ImmArg<ArgIndex<2>>, Range<ArgIndex<2>, 0, 16>
```

#### Same-target vs cross-target (side-by-side)

| Path | Condition | Emitted IR shape |
|---|---|---|
| Same-target (identity or gfx1250→gfx1250, or any future target with `hasTensorOps`) | `ctx.targetIsa.hasTensorOps` true | `call <8 x bfloat> @llvm.amdgcn.cvt.scale.pk8.bf16.fp4(i32 %src, i32 %scale, i32 0)` — backend selects the hardware opcode directly. |
| Cross-target (gfx1250 → gfx942/gfx950, or any target without `hasTensorOps`) | `ctx.targetIsa.hasTensorOps` false | Per-nibble bit-algebra expansion: 8× {FP4 field decomposition, BF16 synthesis, E8M0 exponent-bits add, priority merge} + `insertelement <8 x bfloat>` chain. See `handle_valu.cpp::emitCvtScalePk8Bf16Fp4CrossTargetExpansion`. |

Both paths share the same operand-shape validation (`scale_sel`
immediate present; `scale_sel == 0`). A drift in the shared
validation surfaces on both targets identically.

FP4 ±0.5 maps to BF16 **normal** exp=126 mant=0 (real value 2^-1 is
representable as a BF16 normal, not a subnormal), per the subnormal-
FP4 branch in `mxfp4BitAlgebraBf16Bits`.

#### Corner-case semantics (cross-target expansion)

Per `handle_valu.cpp::emitCvtScalePk8Bf16Fp4CrossTargetExpansion` +
the C++ reference in `mxfp4_dequant.cpp`, all cases are bit-exact
against what the hardware primitive emits on bit-valid inputs in the
declared support set:

| Condition | BF16 result |
|---|---|
| `scale_byte == 0xFF` (E8M0 NaN) | `0x7FC0` (canonical qNaN); wins over FP4 ±0 (IEEE 0 × NaN = NaN) |
| FP4 ±0 × finite scale | `±0` preserving sign |
| `new_exp ≥ 0xFF` (overflow) | `±Inf = sign<<15 | 0x7F80`; BF16 supports Inf even though FP4 does not |
| `new_exp ∈ [1, 0xFE]` (normal) | `sign<<15 | (new_exp<<7) | bf16_mant` |
| `new_exp ≤ 0` (underflow) | Subnormal or ±0 via `(0x80 | bf16_mant) >> (1 - new_exp)`, clamped to 0 at shift ≥ 8 |

**Rounding mode:** N/A. The scale application is a multiplication
by a power of 2, which is exact in floating-point with zero bits of
rounding. We emit integer field manipulation instead of an fmul so
the lowering is bit-identical regardless of the target's float-mode
register state (FTZ / DAZ bits are irrelevant — no fmul runs).

#### Declared support set

**Supported today:** `scale_sel == 0` (i.e. scale byte = `src1 & 0xFF`).

**Refused loudly:** `scale_sel != 0`. The AMD ISA spec's definition
of the 4-bit `scale_sel` field's semantics for the packed-8 FP4 shape
is not reproduced in this tree. The captured gfx1250 corpus
(`scope_discovery/kernels/_matmul_ogs_{06d912ce88af,0af655e6ea2b}.hsaco`,
the two Triton GPT-OSS MoE matmul kernels `_matmul_ogs_NNT_bf16xbf16xmxfp4_*`)
uses only `scale_sel == 0` across 128 instances combined, which has
the unambiguous reading "scale byte is the low byte of the 32-bit
scale register". Widening the support set to `scale_sel != 0`
requires either (a) the AMD ISA spec for gfx1250 to land in-tree with
a precise semantics table, or (b) a new corpus kernel that exercises
the case and a canary extension whose native-gfx1250 run pins the
hardware behaviour.

#### What landing this unblocks

This is **standalone cross-target coverage** for the MXFP4 dequant
primitive; it narrows the kerneldex refusal surface for any future
gfx1250→gfx942 kernel that uses the cvt primitive without going
through scaled-WMMA.

End-to-end lift of the two corpus matmul_ogs kernels
(`_matmul_ogs_06d912ce88af`, `_matmul_ogs_0af655e6ea2b`) still blocks
on pending **Template A** (BF16 16×16×32 WMMA → MFMA; see §T2) and on
async copy / tensor data movement (`global_load_async_to_lds_*`,
landed separately). Those
kernels emit 64× `v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4` + 64× `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_bf16`
+ N× `global_load_async_to_lds_*` each; this work clears the first of
those three blockers, and the kernel raise will surface the other two
in sequence once retried.

#### Regression-guard pointers

| Layer | Path | Pins |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (C++) | `tests/mxfp4_dequant_test.cpp` | OCP table constants; bit-algebra ≡ LUT-via-double on all 4096 inputs; per-corner checks for NaN / ±0 / overflow / underflow |
| Lit (IR shape) | `lit_tests/v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4/v_cvt_scale_pk8_bf16_fp4.ll` | Same-target RUN emits the intrinsic; cross-target RUN emits the bit-algebra expansion, no intrinsic, no LUT constant array |
| Canary (end-to-end) | `the MXFP4 dequant end-to-end canary` | `native` == `hotswap` bit-exact BF16 output across 12-value scale-byte × pseudo-random packed-FP4 sweep; `legacy` expected to crash (SIG6) on the gfx1250-only opcode |

#### Landing commit SHA

_(filled in post-commit)_

### R1 — Unrecognised shape

Every WMMA SemOp has a registered shape descriptor. If an MC opcode
maps to a SemOp whose descriptor has no target mapping, refuse with
`matrixShapeUnsupported`.

### R2 — SWMMAC (2:4 sparsity)

No gfx950 equivalent. Refuse.

### R3 — Unfusible K-doubled pair (§5.2)

### R4 — Divergent EXEC at the WMMA site

WMMA assumes all 32 lanes are active. If SPE predication makes lanes
inactive at the WMMA, the lowering's two-pass model breaks (some
lanes have undefined fragment contents in the replicated copy). The
existing F16 lowering sidesteps this by documenting the assumption
("WMMA operations occur in non-divergent code — EXEC is all-ones",
`wmma_lowering.cpp:89`). Formalise it as a per-kernel gate: every
WMMA instruction must be uniformly reached (SPE's existing uniform-
reachability predicate, to be extended).

Note that "EXEC is all-ones at the WMMA" is an invariant on the
*source-modeled* EXEC (what `emitUnderExec` reads through the
alloca), not the *hardware* EXEC of the target gfx942/gfx950
wavefront. The wave-native projection forces hardware EXEC = -1
kernel-wide via `@llvm.amdgcn.init_whole_wave` at entry (see
`wave-size-translation.md` §5.6.1), so the Wave64-collective
semantics of `ds_bpermute` / MFMA / `v_cndmask` always work across
all 64 lanes regardless of the source kernel's partial-wave launch
shape. What R4 gates is that the source kernel author did not put
the WMMA inside an if-statement that predicates away source lanes
before the collective issues — that remains an IR-shape property
the uniform-reachability predicate can check without looking at
hardware EXEC at all.

### R5 — AGPR-only accumulator expectations

Some MFMA shapes on gfx950 require the accumulator in AGPRs. The
raised IR uses VGPRs; the target backend's AGPR allocator moves them
as needed. If a shape exists that cannot be serviced from VGPR
accumulators (has not been observed), refuse.

## 9. Principled fail-loudly gates

### G1 — Shape registration coverage (startup)

Every SemOp in the WMMA family must have an entry in
`wmma_fragment_layouts` **and** in a shape→target-MFMA mapping
table. Startup verifier
`verifyMatrixShapeCoverage(sourceIsa, targetIsa, opcMap)` fails loud
if any WMMA SemOp lacks a mapping.

### G2 — Per-kernel fusibility scan (pre-Phase-2)

For each Template-B / Template-C shape in the decoded instruction
stream, run the peephole matcher. If any Template-B/C-class WMMA
has no fusible partner, refuse.

### G3 — Uniform-EXEC gate at WMMA site (per-kernel)

At each `V_WMMA_*` decode, check SPE's uniform-reachability
predicate. Refuse on non-uniform.

### G4 — Dtype-table coverage (startup)

For F8F6F4: enumerate the cross-product of (A dtype, B dtype) Gluon
emits and the subset gfx950 supports. Refuse combinations not in
the intersection.

## 10. Engineering tasks

### T1 — Auto-generate fragment tables

Stand up a one-time generator from AMD Matrix Instruction Calculator
output (Python script under the hotswap source tree) producing
`wmma_fragment_layouts.inc` consumed by `wmma_lowering.cpp`. ~300
LoC; removes the hand-transcribed table as a source of bugs.

### T2 — BF16 and I8 16×16×32 shapes (Template A)

Extend `handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` to dispatch on new SemOps
`V_WMMA_F32_16x16x32_BF16`, `V_WMMA_I32_16x16x32_IU8`. Each is a
direct parallel of the F16 code with pack/unpack dtype substitutions
and the auto-generated layout table. ~200 LoC each.

### T3 — F8F6F4 shapes (Template B, no scale)

Add `V_WMMA_F32_16x16x64_F8F6F4` SemOp. Implement the
fusibility peephole in a new post-decode pass
`detectMatrixFusions(insts)` that annotates pairs. Handler emits one
`mfma_16x16x128_f8f6f4` per fused pair; solo WMMAs trigger G2
refusal. ~400 LoC (peephole ~150, handler ~250).

### T4 — Scaled WMMA (Template C) for MXFP

Add `V_WMMA_SCALED_F32_16x16x64_F8F6F4`. Extend the peephole from T3
to handle the scaled variant. Implement scale-layout redistribution
(new tables). Handler emits `mfma_scale_16x16x128_f8f6f4`. ~500 LoC.

### T5 — Uniform-reachability predicate for WMMA sites (G3)

Reuse SPE's uniform-reachability analysis (already required by
`wave-size-translation.md §5.1`). Extend `SemOpAttrs` with
`requiresUniformExec` and set it on every WMMA SemOp. Per-kernel
gate fires automatically once the attr is honoured. ~40 LoC.

Dependency order: **T1 first** (unblocks every other task). T2 and
T5 in parallel. T3, then T4.

## 11. Testing strategy

- Oracle: run the source gfx1250 kernel on a gfx1250 device (or in
  a reference CPU implementation) and compare tile outputs element-
  wise at tolerance appropriate for the dtype.
- Per-shape validation: each shape should have a focused source fixture,
  a translated target object, and a target-side numerical comparison.
- Randomised inputs with deterministic seeding.
- Scale-path tests: round-trip an MXFP encoding through both
  architectures, compare bit-for-bit where feasible and
  element-wise otherwise.

## 12. Staging state — ModuloReplicationProjection-aware lowering (2026-04-22)

> **Status:** infrastructure landed. The ModuloReplicationProjection-aware
> lowering described in this section is available behind the same proof
> obligations as the rest of the wave-size projection machinery. The
> `matmul_fp16_16x16` shape is covered by end-to-end validation; larger
> BLOCK=32 shapes with multiple parallel WMMAs remain the stress case for
> this lowering family.

The WMMA → MFMA lowering in `wmma_lowering.cpp` now supports TWO
projections:

1. **`WaveNativeProjection`** — the baseline. Kernel-entry
   `@llvm.amdgcn.init_whole_wave` provides HW `EXEC = -1` kernel-
   wide, so the `runGroupPass` pipeline runs with every target lane
   participating. End-to-end validation covers this path.

2. **`ModuloReplicationProjection`** (phantom-lane fallback for
   `max_flat_workgroup_size < targetWaveSize`). HW
   EXEC stays at the source-active mask kernel-wide, so target lanes
   past the source-wave width are HW-inactive for the rest of the
   kernel body (which is the whole point of the phantom-lane
   fallback — their undef VGPRs can't contaminate cross-lane ops).
   The WMMA lowering scopes a local HW-EXEC = -1 region around just
   the redistribute / MFMA / collect chain by wrapping the MFMA
   outputs and each collect-output dword in `@llvm.amdgcn.strict.wwm`,
   which the AMDGPU backend's `SIWholeQuadMode` pass expands into
   a proper scoped region (materialising as `s_or_saveexec_b64 sN,
   -1` entry / `s_mov_b64 exec, sN` exit in the final HSACO).

The MODREP path is correct on focused reproducers, including isolated and
K-loop-chained WMMAs verified by `lit_tests/wmma_phantom_lane_f16_chain/`.
Broader matrix kernels remain the stress surface for this path; refusal gates
should only be relaxed with matching end-to-end evidence.

### 12.1 Infrastructure summary

| Symbol | Signature | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `WaveProjection::numSourceWavesPerTarget()` | `virtual unsigned` — pure virtual | Returns 1 under MODREP (phantom-lane = single source wave) or same-wave projections; 2 under `WaveNativeProjection` wave32→wave64 cross-widen; `report_fatal_error` under the unimplemented `ThreadLoopProjection`. Pure so every new projection class must answer the question explicitly. |
| `WaveProjection::wrapAsWWMValue(B, v)` | `Value *` helper | No-op under projections that guarantee HW EXEC=-1 kernel-wide (`WaveNativeProjection`); emits a per-value `@llvm.amdgcn.strict.wwm` call otherwise. Accepts any scalar/fixed-vector integer or floating-point type supported by the intrinsic's overload set; asserts on other types. |
| `emitWMMAtoMFMA*` (internal) | — | Now iterates `runGroupPass` for `numSourceWavesPerTarget()` passes and wraps MFMA outputs + collect-output dwords via `wrapAsWWMValue`. Release-build-safe `report_fatal_error` guards catch a refusal-gate regression that flips the gate without vetting the MODREP path. |

### 12.2 Gate-flip protocol

When the `matmul_fp16_16x16` residual is pinned and the MODREP path
is ready to enable:

1. **Prove correctness** with end-to-end validation for `matmul_fp16`
   and `matmul_fp16_16x16`: all shapes must match, not merely avoid a
   translation failure.
2. **Drop the refusal gates** in `handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` (both the
   K=4 f32 arm and the K=32/K=64 arm). The `!providesFullWaveExec
   Invariant()` check and its `RaiseFailure::unsupportedShape`
   branch are the only pieces removed; the rest of the dispatch
   (native `hasTensorOps` path, `hasMFMA` cross-target path, no-
   path-available refusal) stays exactly as-is.
3. **Flip the lit fixture**
   `lit_tests/wmma_phantom_lane_f16_chain/wmma_phantom_lane_f16_chain.ll`
   from refusal-CHECKs to affirmative IR-shape CHECKs. The fixture
   header spells out the specific anchors the flipped version
   should pin (strict.wwm markers, single-pass runGroupPass output,
   MFMA chain).
4. **Flip the lit fixture**
   `lit_tests/wmma_phantom_lane_refuse/wmma_phantom_lane_refuse.ll`
   similarly — the K=4 f32 variant.
5. **Drop the release-build-safe guards** in `emitWMMAtoMFMA*`
   (`if (numSrcWaves != 2) report_fatal_error(...)`) once the
   `numSrcWaves == 1` branch is live. Keep the `numSrcWaves ∉ {1,
   2}` guard — that's a contract check for new projection classes.

### 12.3 Prerequisite ABI fix — `ttmp7` init for `workgroup_id_y/z` (2026-04-22)

The AMDGPU backend's entry-function ABI for gfx12+ preloads
`workgroup_id_y` and `workgroup_id_z` into a packed `ttmp7` by
`SIMachineFunctionInfo`'s argument-descriptor table (see LLVM's
`AMDGPULegalizerInfo::loadInputValue`):

```cpp
WorkGroupIDY = ArgDescriptor::createRegister(TTMP7, 0xFFFFu);
WorkGroupIDZ = ArgDescriptor::createRegister(TTMP7, 0xFFFF0000u);
```

i.e. `ttmp7[15:0] = workgroup_id_y`, `ttmp7[31:16] = workgroup_id_z`.
Triton-generated gfx1250 kernels read the Y component via the
canonical idiom:

```
s_and_b32 sDST, ttmp7, 0xffff       ; wg_id_y
```

`raiser.cpp`'s Phase-4 entry init previously initialised `ttmp9`
(`workgroup_id_x`) and `ttmp8[29:25]` (`wave_id_in_workgroup`)
for the canonical Tensile / rocBLAS BFE pattern, but left `ttmp7`
uninitialised.  Under MODREP the uninitialised SGPR read as
whatever the alloca's initial pattern yielded — effectively
always zero — so every 2D-grid kernel's `workgroup_id_y` collapsed
onto the Y=0 column.

Bisection trace (against `matmul_fp16_16x16` M=32, all-ones ×
all-ones; expected output every cell = K = 32; host harness
`/tmp/matmul_test.cpp` in-session):

| Column range | Observed | Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| cols 0..15 | 32.0 (correct) | WG(\*, pid_n=0) writes |
| cols 16..31 | `0xCDCD` (poison) | WG(\*, pid_n=1) never writes — all WGs see `pid_n = 0` |

The pattern is unambiguous: the kernel body was running every
workgroup to completion but every WG wrote to its `pid_n=0`
destination region, so the Y=1 column of workgroups landed atop
the Y=0 column and the Y=1 output region retained the host's
pre-launch `0xCD` memset poison.

The fix (in `raiser.cpp`'s `if (AMDGPU::isGFX12Plus(...))` block):

```cpp
// ttmp7 = (workgroup_id_z << 16) | (workgroup_id_y & 0xFFFF)
Value *wgIdY = B.CreateCall(fnWorkgroupIdY, {}, "ttmp7_wg_id_y");
Value *wgIdZ = B.CreateCall(fnWorkgroupIdZ, {}, "ttmp7_wg_id_z");
Value *wgIdYLo = B.CreateAnd(wgIdY, B.getInt32(0xFFFF), "wg_id_y_lo16");
Value *wgIdZHi = B.CreateShl(wgIdZ, B.getInt32(16), "wg_id_z_hi16");
Value *ttmp7Val = B.CreateOr(wgIdYLo, wgIdZHi, "ttmp7_val");
B.CreateStore(ttmp7Val, regs.ttmp[7]);
```

Masking Y to 16 bits before the OR is safe on no-Z kernels (the
backend's mask there is `~0u`; the consumer's `s_and ttmp7,
0xffff` discards the upper bits regardless) and is the principled
all-cases shape for 2D/3D grid kernels alike.

**Regression fence:** `lit_tests/ttmp7_workgroup_id_yz_init/`
pins the `@llvm.amdgcn.workgroup.id.{y,z}` + `shl ..., 16`
IR shape at kernel entry.  A backwards-stride to pre-fix behaviour
would drop at least one of those three anchors.

### 12.4 Remaining `matmul_fp16` divergence — multi-WMMA + `v_permlane16_swap_b32`

With §12.3's fix applied and the refusal gate lifted locally,
`matmul_fp16_16x16` passes 5/5 in end-to-end validation.  The sibling
`matmul_fp16` (BLOCK=32, four parallel WMMAs per WG, epilogue
without LDS round-trip) still diverges for non-uniform inputs.

Host-harness bisection with deterministic `mode ∈ {0, 3..6}` input
generators narrows the residual (harness not checked in — rebuilding
for a future investigation is the right step, not re-reading the
prior session's `/tmp` file):

| Mode | A layout | B layout | Expected | Observed | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | all 1s | all 1s | C[i,j] = K = 32 | C[i,j] = 32 | ✓ match |
| 6 | A[i,k]=i/16 | all 1s | C[i,j] = 2i | C[i,j] = 2i | ✓ match |
| 5 | all 1s | B[k,j]=j/16 | C[i,j] = 2j | C[i,j] = 2(j±8 mod 16) | ✗ mismatch (cols 0..15: got=ref+16; cols 16..31: got=ref-16) |

The A-only-varying and all-uniform cases being bitwise correct
while the B-only-varying case is systematically off by the
sub-tile width strongly suggests the bug is specific to B's
data-flow path rather than the (A↔B-symmetric) redistribute
math, MFMA intrinsic choice, or collect mapping.  This is a
bisection hypothesis, not a formal proof — a data-dependent
redistribute bug that happens to thread the wrong SSA value as
the B fragment while A's SSA is correct would show the same
asymmetry.  Getting to a formal localisation needs either a
minimal synthetic repro kernel that isolates the B-path (in
progress; `quad_wmma_kernel` sketched in-session but didn't
cleanly reproduce the ±16 pattern) or an MIR-level dump after
`si-wqm` / regalloc to observe the B-operand vreg threading.

Two confounded differentiators between the working
`matmul_fp16_16x16` and the failing `matmul_fp16`:

  1. **`v_permlane16_swap_b32` presence.**  `matmul_fp16` emits
     8 of these (one per A-fragment dword pair); `matmul_fp16_16x16`
     emits zero.
  2. **Multi-WMMA per WG.**  `matmul_fp16` has 4 parallel WMMAs
     per workgroup (a 2×2 output sub-tile grid);
     `matmul_fp16_16x16` has 1.

With only one sample on each side I can't separate these
empirically.  The candidate root causes below apply under either.

The swap sequence emitted by Triton for `matmul_fp16`:

```
v_permlane16_swap_b32_e32 v186, v194   ; A fragment pair 0
v_permlane16_swap_b32_e32 v187, v195
...
v_permlane16_swap_b32_e32 v193, v201   ; A fragment pair 7
```

Each swap exchanges a register PAIR between lanes 0..15 and 16..31,
setting up the two-row-tile A fragment distribution.  The lift
decomposes each `v_permlane16_swap_b32 vdst, src0` into a pair of
EXEC-ungated `ds_bpermute` reads using `lane_id XOR 16` as the
partner selector — semantics are correct per the AMDGPU ISA spec,
and individual `v_permlane16_swap_b32` lit fixtures (`c2_permlane_swap`)
pass.  The bug surfaces only under the joint regime:

- MODREP phantom-lane projection (source-active lanes 0..31 only);
- Four PARALLEL WMMAs (not chained via accumulator PHIs) sharing
  A and B operand vregs after the swap;
- Non-uniform B input so the swap'd-vreg data matters.

### 12.5 Prerequisite ABI fix — `amdgpu-lds-size` propagation (2026-04-22)

Second prerequisite ABI bug surfaced during the matmul_fp16 multi-
WMMA investigation, this time in the lifted kernel's static LDS
allocation.

**Symptom.**  A HIP kernel that declares `__shared__ uint8_t lds[N]`
and cross-thread-shuffles through LDS (thread T writes its slot,
then reads `((T ^ 16) & 31)`'s slot) had every cross-thread read
return zero after lift to gfx942.  Same-thread reads of an own-slot
write returned correct data (LLVM's forward-propagation elides the
LDS round-trip when it proves the read sees the same value the
write stored).  Static LDS was the trigger; dynamic LDS (via
`extern __shared__ T arr[]` + `sharedMemBytes` launcher argument)
behaved correctly.

**Bisection.**  The `lds_probe` synthetic (`/tmp/wmma_lds_probe.hip`
in-session) isolated to: "cross-thread static-LDS reads return 0,
same-thread reads return correct data."  Inspecting the lifted
HSACO's KD metadata revealed `.group_segment_fixed_size: 0` despite
the source's `.group_segment_fixed_size: 4096`.

**Root cause.**  `raiser.cpp` emits LDS operations via raw
`inttoptr i64 to ptr addrspace(3)` arithmetic — no module-level
`addrspace(3)` `GlobalVariable`s.  The AMDGPU backend's KD emitter
derives `group_segment_fixed_size` from addrspace(3) GVs plus the
`amdgpu-lds-size` per-function attribute (see
`AMDGPUMachineFunctionInfo::AMDGPUMachineFunctionInfo` —
`LDSSizeRange.first` is read from the attr).  With neither GVs
nor the attr, the emitter defaults to 0 and every LDS access
targets an unallocated segment; reads return zero on gfx942.

**Fix.**  `raiser.cpp`'s Phase-4 kernel-setup mirrors the source's
`.group_segment_fixed_size` into an `amdgpu-lds-size` function
attribute with `"N,N"` (min=max, since we know the source's static
size exactly).  Zero-size sources skip the attribute entirely
so `group_segment_fixed_size` stays 0 and dynamic LDS (which
flows through the launcher's `sharedMemBytes` on top of the
static segment) keeps working.

**Regression fence.**  `lit_tests/group_segment_fixed_size_attr/`
pins the attribute's presence + value + the presence of at least
one addrspace(3) load/store in the lifted IR (so the fixture
doesn't pass vacuously if a future refactor elides the LDS
entirely).

**Relationship to matmul_fp16.**  `matmul_fp16` has
`.group_segment_fixed_size: 0` and uses DYNAMIC LDS (512 / 2048
bytes at launch per the Triton sidecar), so my fix does not
affect its KD.  The matmul_fp16 multi-WMMA residual documented
in §12.4 persists after this fix — it's a separate bug.

### 12.4.3 Session-4 per-cell characterization (2026-04-22)

Pinned the mode-5 error pattern to a PRECISE bit-level shape:

  * For ALL rows i and cols j, got[i, j] = 2*(j mod 16) + 16.
  * All 32 rows of the 32×32 output are IDENTICAL (which is
    correct for mode 5 since A=1s makes output lane-independent).
  * Both sub-tile WMMAs (WMMA(0,0) writing cols 0..15 and
    WMMA(0,1) writing cols 16..31) produce the SAME per-cell
    value at matching col_local — i.e., got[i, j_local] ==
    got[i, j_local+16] for every j_local in [0,16).

This mathematically constrains the bug to: "BOTH WMMAs receive
B fragment starting at B matrix col 8 (not B col 0 and B col 16
respectively)."  Proof: mode-5 B[k, j] = j/16.  If the MFMA
K=32 aggregate = K * B_val, observed K*B_val per cell = 2*col_local
+ 16.  Solving: B_val = col_local/16 + 0.5 = (col_local+8)/16.
That's B[k, col_local+8] — a +8-column shift from the expected
fragment-start.

The +8 col shift is UNIFORM across BOTH sub-tile WMMAs.  That
rules out a per-WMMA fragment-indexing bug (which would shift
sub-tile 0 and sub-tile 1 independently) and localises the
corruption to a step SHARED between the two WMMAs — most
plausibly the LDS round-trip (writes originate in a single
`ds_store_b16` sweep both WMMAs' B data shares) OR the B-fragment
redistribute pre-sharing across the two WMMAs.

**Next investigation step**: add a debug `global_store` of
v[170] and v[178] (the first dwords of B fragments for WMMA(0,0)
and WMMA(0,1) respectively) right after the source's
`ds_load_b128` that populates them.  For mode 5 with correct
lifting, source-active lane 0's v[170] should hold B[k, 0..3]
fp16 values = {0, 1/16, 2/16, 3/16} and v[178] should hold
B[k, 16..19] = {16/16, 17/16, 18/16, 19/16}.  If instead both
v[170] and v[178] hold {8/16, 9/16, 10/16, 11/16}, the LDS
round-trip confirms the "+8 col shift" origin and the bug is
in the load→LDS→read path, not in the WMMA lift.  Otherwise
the shift happens post-LDS in one of the redistribute /
permlane16_swap / MFMA steps.

### 12.4.2 Session-3 synthetic bisection (2026-04-22)

Built a set of bisection repros to isolate `matmul_fp16`'s residual
from its structural confounders.  All repros use
`__launch_bounds__(32)` so they're in the same MODREP phantom-lane
regime as `matmul_fp16`, and the test harness
(`/tmp/repro_test.cpp`) compares each quad-WMMA kernel's output
slot-by-slot against a single-WMMA kernel fed the same inputs.
Identical inputs to the same WMMA intrinsic MUST yield identical
outputs; any slot divergence indicates a lift bug.

| Repro                                     | Structure                                             | Mode 0 | Mode 5 |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| `single_wmma_X`                           | 1 WMMA, per-lane global load, no LDS, no swap         | baseline | baseline |

| **Triton `matmul_fp16` (BLOCK=32)**       | Real kernel, 4 WMMAs, dynamic LDS                     | **pass** | **1024/1024 ✗** |

† LDS round-trip was elided by `-O2` forward-propagation on
disjoint per-thread slots.

‡ Required the `amdgpu-lds-size` fix (commit `f411ec81b4`) to pass;
pre-fix these failed because `.group_segment_fixed_size: 0` in the
lifted HSACO made every LDS access target an unallocated segment
and return zero.

**Falsified hypotheses** from this matrix:

  * **Multi-WMMA alone**: `quad_wmma_X` passes.  4 parallel WMMAs
    sharing A and B operand vregs is correctly lifted.
  * **`v_permlane16_swap_b32` alone**: `quad_wmma_swap` passes.
    The swap lift + multi-WMMA interaction is fine.
  * **Cross-thread LDS shuffle alone**: `quad_wmma_cross_lds{,_noswap}`
    pass post the `amdgpu-lds-size` fix.  The fragment reshuffle
    via LDS works under MODREP.
  * **Dynamic LDS**: `quad_wmma_dyn_lds` passes.  Dynamic LDS
    (via `extern __shared__` + `sharedMemBytes` launch argument)
    is correctly handled.

`matmul_fp16`'s `got = ref ± 16` per-sub-tile residual persists
despite EVERY structural component of its pre-WMMA pipeline
(multi-WMMA, permlane16_swap, cross-thread LDS shuffle, dynamic
LDS) individually passing as a synthetic.  The residual must
therefore be in an interaction my synthetics do not exercise:

  * **K-loop accumulator PHI**.  `matmul_fp16`'s four `v[2:9]`,
    `v[10:17]`, `v[18:25]`, `v[26:33]` accumulator vreg-ranges
    are loop-carried through a K-loop.  For M=32 / BLOCK_K=32
    the loop body runs once, but the LIFT builds SSA phi nodes
    with two incoming values (init 0 and back-edge update).
    For phantom lanes the init-side of the phi is undef from
    the (inactive) `spe_skip` path; the WMMA-redistribute that
    follows reads these phis' first-iteration values under
    WWM, and if the backend's value-numbering can't prove the
    back-edge path is dead for lane-uniform data, the MFMA
    accumulator may observe a phantom-lane-contaminated value.
  * **`v_dual_mov_b32` / `v_dual_bitop2_b32` VOPD interaction**.
    `matmul_fp16` heavily uses dual-issue VOPD ops to
    initialise the accumulator (`v_dual_mov_b32 v3, v2 ::
    v_dual_mov_b32 v6, v2` pattern, etc.).  The VOPD lift in
    `handle_vopd.cpp` handles `v_bitop2_b32` correctly (LUT
    expansion, verified in isolation), but a specific SEQUENCE
    of VOPD ops that end up in the K-loop body may introduce
    a subtle data-dependency the backend mishandles.
  * **Runtime instrumentation is the next step**.  The cleanest
    way to discriminate between these is to insert a debug
    `global_store` of the MFMA-1 C operand vector right before
    the first `mfma.f32.16x16x16f16` call and compare against
    the expected all-zeros.  If C is NOT zero on source-active
    lane 0, the accumulator-PHI / VOPD-lift hypotheses are
    confirmed; if C IS zero, the bug moves downstream of the
    MFMA itself.

### 12.4.1 Additional session findings (2026-04-22)

Session 2 ran several directed experiments; the residual is still
open, but the evidence pool has narrowed:

  * **Mode-3 mis-layout is NOT a uniform ±16 shift.**  With
    `A[i,k] = (i*32+k)/64` and `B = identity` (so the reference is
    `C[i,j] = A[i,j]`), row 0 of the output is bitwise correct (all
    32 cells), while row 1 shows a mixed pattern:
      * `C[1, 0]` is correct (`0.5`);
      * `C[1, 1..7]` return `0.0` (expected `A[1, 1..7]` ∈
        `[0.5156, 0.6094]`);
      * `C[1, 8..15]` return `A[1, j] + A[1, j+8]` (a SUM of two
        matrix cells);
      * `C[1, 16..23]` show the same values as `C[1, 8..15]`;
      * rows 2..31 all fail.
    This is not a single-axis shift; the interaction mixes values
    across BOTH the row and column axes, which rules out the
    simplest "fragment accidentally off by K" / "stride-by-one"
    hypotheses.

  * **MFMA-output `strict.wwm` wrap is NOT load-bearing for
    correctness on single-WMMA kernels.**  Dropping the
    `wrapAsWWMValue` calls on `mfma1` / `mfma2` results (keeping
    only the collect-dword wrap) — leaving `SIWholeQuadMode` to
    propagate WWM backward from the collect — keeps
    `matmul_fp16_16x16` bitwise correct across all five shapes AND
    does NOT change `matmul_fp16`'s mode-5 failure pattern (same
    1024/1024 mismatches, same ±16 offset).  This falsifies
    candidate #1's narrow form (MFMA-output WWM region collapse),
    though a broader "WWM region interacts badly with multi-WMMA
    regalloc" variant is still live.

  * **LDS reads sit INSIDE the WWM region in both kernels.**
    Disassembling the lifted HSACOs shows the `ds_read_b128` loading
    the B fragment lives between `s_or_saveexec_b64 sN, -1` and
    `s_mov_b64 exec, sN`.  Under `EXEC = -1`, all 64 target lanes
    (including phantom lanes 32..63) execute the LDS read; the
    phantom lanes compute LDS addresses from their own `lane_id` /
    `mbcnt` output, which point past the LDS segment the source-
    active lanes wrote — so those lanes read zero / uninitialised
    LDS, and their MFMA output is whatever that data computes to.
    This would naturally break target lanes 32..47 / 48..63, whose
    collect-stage bperm reads feed source-active lanes 16..31 (the
    second half of each wave32's output fragment).  `matmul_fp16_16x16`
    has the same pattern but passes, so the phantom-LDS-read
    hypothesis must have a mitigating factor on the 16×16 path —
    perhaps because its collect doesn't need the phantom lanes'
    MFMA output (the output tile is 16×16 so only the first 16 of
    every 32 per-lane outputs are consumed via the store pattern).
    VERIFY: trace `matmul_fp16_16x16`'s per-lane output STORE
    addressing; if it never reads source-lanes 16..31 of the
    collect (e.g. the Triton-emitted epilogue only stores lane 0..15
    output to C because BLOCK_M=16), the phantom-LDS-read corruption
    would land only in unused VGPR slots and not surface.

  * **Hand-rolled `quad_wmma_kernel` / `single_wmma_kernel` repros
    are INVALID.**  Each lane in my sketched repros loads `A0[0]`
    uniformly (not per-lane fragment-distributed), so every lane
    feeds the same <16 x half> into the WMMA and the intrinsic's
    cross-lane aggregation returns a non-meaningful result (the
    "all-15" / "all-0" per-lane output on mode-5 / mode-6 that I
    couldn't interpret earlier).  A valid repro needs to manually
    distribute the A/B matrix across lanes per the gfx12 wave32
    WMMA fragment layout — this is the next concrete step.

Candidate root causes to investigate next (ordered by suspicion,
all unverified — these are TODOs, not localisations):

1. **`strict.wwm` region collapse across multiple parallel MFMAs.**
   Each of the 4 source WMMAs lowers to a pair of chained MFMAs
   (K=32 → 2× K=16) wrapped in `@llvm.amdgcn.strict.wwm`.  The
   backend's `SIWholeQuadMode` pass may merge the 8 MFMA regions
   into a single large WWM scope; `SIPreAllocateWWMRegs`'s
   dedicated-physreg-per-WWM-vreg requirement may then produce a
   spill/reload pattern that crosses the swap's partner-lane read
   boundary.  Verify via MIR dump after `si-wqm` + `si-pre-
   allocate-wwm-regs` on the lifted IR.
2. **Redistribute-step CSE across WMMAs sharing operands.**  The
   B fragment for WMMA(0,0) and WMMA(1,0) derives from the same
   source vreg pair `b[170:177]`.  The LLVM mid-level CSE may
   collapse the redistribute's per-WMMA `ds.bpermute` calls into
   a single SSA value reused across both WMMAs.  If one WMMA's
   redistribute path happens to land before the swap and another
   after, the shared SSA values encode the wrong B fragment for
   one of them.  Verify via `-print-after-all` on the IR's mid-
   level pipeline, specifically GVN / CSE passes.
3. **Scoped-WWM alternative lowering.**  The file header comment
   in `wmma_lowering.cpp` (lines 152-173) documents an earlier
   design that was abandoned because `SIPreAllocateWWMRegs`
   exhausted the 256-VGPR pool on 128×128 f16 matmuls.  The
   abandoned design wrapped MFMA outputs in `strict.wwm`; the
   current code re-introduces `strict.wwm` via `wrapAsWWMValue`
   for MODREP.  A genuinely scoped `s_or_saveexec_b64 sN, -1`
   → MFMA → `s_mov_b64 exec, sN` sequence emitted directly by
   the raiser (no `strict.wwm` markers, no WWM-region allocator
   dependency) would sidestep both issues.

Until one of these is pinned, the K=32/K=64 refusal gate stays
in place — the principled outcome for `matmul_fp16` remains
EXIT=2 (refuse), and the gate's diagnostic in
`handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` now surfaces the `matmul_fp16_16x16` WIN
and the `matmul_fp16` OPEN items explicitly.

### 12.4.4 Session-5 per-dword characterization (2026-04-23)

Adding inline IR instrumentation (text-patched `global_store`
immediately before the `wmma.f32.16x16x32.f16` intrinsic build)
pinned the per-lane K distribution of BOTH operand slots by
running the kernel with distinguishing input modes.

**Harness** (`/tmp/instrument.py` + extended `/tmp/matmul_test.cpp`):
the patched IR writes 16 dwords per lane (v170.2..v177.2 for
WMMA.B, v186.3..v193.3 AND v194.3..v201.3 for WMMA.A) to a
kernarg-added debug buffer, read back and decoded per lane.
Mode 7 (`A[i,k]=k/32`, `B=1s`) and mode 9 (`A[i,k]=i+k*32`,
`B=1s`) let the value at any half uniquely identify the
Triton-matrix coordinate the WMMA fragment holds; modes 8 and 10
do the same for Triton.B.

**WMMA.B operand (v170-177) per-lane layout** (empirically pinned,
K-split between lane halves — matches the `gfx12` WMMA doc
comment in `wmma_lowering.cpp::redistributeInput` verbatim):

| Lanes | dw{0,1} | dw{2,3} | dw{4,5} | dw{6,7} |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0-15  | k=0-3   | k=8-11  | k=16-19 | k=24-27 |
| 16-31 | k=4-7   | k=12-15 | k=20-23 | k=28-31 |

Each lane holds row=L%16 of the WMMA.B-slot operand (which in
Triton's swapped layout holds Triton.A data) across 16 K-values
per lane.  Lanes 0 and 16 both hold row 0, with disjoint K sets
that together span K=0..31.  The current `redistributeInput` is
CORRECT for this layout (verified by modes 6 and 7 passing —
both have Triton.B=1s so only the WMMA.B redistribution can
surface variation).

**WMMA.A operand (v186-193) per-lane layout** (empirically pinned,
SURPRISE: NOT K-split — col-split between lane halves, SAME K set
at each GPR position across both halves):

| Lanes | dw{0,1} | dw{2,3} | dw{4,5} | dw{6,7} |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0-15  | k=8-11 col=16+L%16 | k=12-15 col=16+L%16 | k=24-27 col=16+L%16 | k=28-31 col=16+L%16 |
| 16-31 | k=8-11 col=L%16    | k=12-15 col=L%16    | k=24-27 col=L%16    | k=28-31 col=L%16    |

Lanes 0-15 hold cols 16-31 and lanes 16-31 hold cols 0-15 of
Triton.B.  Both halves hold the SAME K subset (`{8-15, 24-31}`).
The OTHER K subset (`{0-7, 16-23}`) is in v194-201 with the same
col-split pattern — so together v186-v201 (16 VGPRs × 32 lanes ×
2 halves/dw = 1024 halves) covers Triton.B's full 32×32.  But
the WMMA instruction consumes only v186-193 (8 VGPRs) as its A
operand — per the instruction encoding and the LLVM intrinsic
signature (`<16 x half>` A, `<16 x half>` B).

**This is the remaining open question**: how does the gfx1250
WMMA hardware assemble a full 16×32 A matrix from v186-193's 512
halves when those halves only cover 16 K values × 32 cols (not
32 K × 16 rows)?  One possibility: the hardware has an
implicit-stride read pattern that treats v[A:A+7] and v[A+8:A+15]
as a single operand (matrix_b_reuse extension); another: the
(row_hw, K_hw) lane/dw/half mapping is a non-trivial permutation
that still yields a valid 16×32 matrix when interpreted by the
matmul unit.  Neither matches any documented layout in
`llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/VOP3PInstructions.td`
or its surrounding lowering code.

**Consequence for the MFMA lowering**: `redistributeInput` is
symmetric across A and B (same code path for `aDwords` and
`bDwords`), so the K-split assumption bakes in for WMMA.A too.
Mode 8 (`B[k,j]=k/32`, where Triton.B → WMMA.A slot is K-varying)
surfaces this as a uniform +4 error on every output cell:
`got = 19.5 vs ref = 15.5`.  Hand-calc confirms both MFMA-1 and
MFMA-2 double-count `{k=8-15, 24-31}` and miss `{0-7, 16-23}` —
consistent with the col-split layout returning the same K set for
LG0/LG1 and LG2/LG3 (and zero coverage of the `{0-7, 16-23}` K
half that lives in v194-201).

**Gate reinstated**: the refusal gate in
`handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` now cites §12.4.4 directly.  Fixing this
requires one of:

  1. Decoding the gfx1250 WMMA.A ISA layout (how lane L, dw g, half h
     maps to (row_hw, K_hw)) and writing an asymmetric
     `redistributeInput_A` that accounts for it.
  2. Lifting `v_permlane16_swap_b32` differently so that its post-
     swap data matches the K-split layout that `redistributeInput`
     assumes, rather than the observed col-split.  (The pre-swap
     data layout is unobserved; Session-6 TODO.)
  3. Extending the WMMA → MFMA lowering to take BOTH v186-193 AND
     v194-201 as a 16-VGPR A input; this requires lifting the
     WMMA intrinsic call to consume a `<32 x half>` (or two
     `<16 x half>` values), which is a raiser-level change not
     currently in scope.

Session-5's debug instrumentation code lives at `/tmp/instrument.py`
(text-patch the lifted IR) and `/tmp/matmul_test.cpp` (host harness
with modes 7/8/9/10 added).  These should be reimplemented as a
proper `wmma_fragment_decode` lit-test fixture when this
investigation resumes.

### 12.4.5 Session-6 refusal-gate narrowing (2026-04-23)

The Session-5 refusal gate was too broad: it blocked the K=32/K=64
WMMA→MFMA lowering for EVERY MODREP kernel, even single-WMMA-per-K-
iter kernels like `matmul_fp16_16x16` whose lowering the rest of
this document's analysis validates.  End-to-end corpus validation confirms
`matmul_fp16_16x16` produces 5/5 `match` output with the gate off
(see the corresponding validation results) — the gate was a
false-positive refusal on that corpus recipe.

The root cause of `matmul_fp16`'s remaining wrongness is specific to
the MULTI-WMMA-per-K-iter regime: when Triton emits 4 WMMAs sharing
operand halves (v186-193 and v194-201 combined form the full 32-K
A matrix), the raiser's single-WMMA-intrinsic model can only see
one 8-VGPR range per WMMA, losing the other half of K.  The
structural marker of this regime is a `v_permlane16_swap_b32`
emission Triton uses to bridge the cross-half fragment layout.
Single-WMMA kernels never emit this opcode.

**Narrowed gate** (2026-04-23):

  * `raiser.cpp` pre-scans the decoded instruction stream once and
    sets `RaiseContext::kernelHasPermlane16Swap` if any
    `V_PERMLANE16_SWAP_B32` is present.
  * `handle_valu_vop3p.cpp`'s K=32/K=64 (and K=4 f32) WMMA→MFMA
    refusal gates now require BOTH
    `!projection.providesFullWaveExecInvariant()` (MODREP) AND
    `ctx.kernelHasPermlane16Swap` (multi-WMMA marker) to refuse.
  * Single-WMMA-per-K-iter kernels under MODREP now lift through
    the validated `emitWMMAtoMFMA` / `emitWMMAtoMFMA_F32_16x16x4`
    paths instead of refusing.
  * Multi-WMMA-per-K-iter kernels still refuse loudly with the
    §12.4.4 root-cause citation.

**Lit fixture updates** that fell out of the narrowing:

  * `lit_tests/wmma_phantom_lane_refuse/wmma_phantom_lane_refuse.ll`
    — rewritten from `%not`-refusal CHECKs to affirmative
    CHECKs on the emitted MFMA K=4 f32 call + `strict.wwm` wrap
    (the kernel has no `permlane16_swap`, so the surgical gate
    correctly lets it through).
  * `lit_tests/wmma_phantom_lane_f16_chain/wmma_phantom_lane_f16_chain.ll`
    — rewritten similarly to pin the 2-WMMA-chain K=32 f16 IR
    shape (MFMA call + strict.wwm + collect bpermute).

The still-broken `matmul_fp16` path's fix is the same open set
enumerated in §12.4.4 above (decode WMMA.A ISA layout, re-lift
permlane16_swap, or raise a 16-VGPR `<32 x half>` A input); the
narrowed gate just stops collateral damage to kernels that aren't
actually affected by that investigation.

### 12.4.6 Session-7 layout investigation — where we got stuck (2026-04-23)

A follow-on investigation against Triton's WMMA lowering
(`third_party/amd/lib/TritonAMDGPUToLLVM/DotOpToLLVM/WMMA.cpp`,
`lib/Dialect/TritonGPU/IR/LinearLayoutConversions.cpp::wmmaDotOperandToLinearLayout`
and the `AMDWmmaEncodingAttr` doc in
`TritonGPUAttrDefs.td`) plus pre-swap `v_permlane16_swap_b32`
instrumentation pinned down three additional structural facts.
They close some doors but don't yet open the fix:

**Fact 1 — the `isTransposed` operand swap is real.** For
`version=3 isTransposed=true` (matmul_fp16's layout)
`generateWMMAOp` calls `wmma(hb, ha, ...)`, i.e. the WMMA.A
intrinsic operand slot receives Triton's B tensor data (`hb`) and
the WMMA.B slot receives Triton's A data (`ha`).  Per-thread
data-flow:

  * `ha` (WMMA.B slot, v170-177 in matmul_fp16): Triton.A values.
  * `hb` (WMMA.A slot, v186-193 in matmul_fp16): Triton.B values.

The WMMA instruction therefore computes
`D_wmma = hb × ha = Triton.B × Triton.A = (Triton.A × Triton.B)^T`
and Triton stores `D` with the matching transposed output
encoding.

**Fact 2 — per-operand LinearLayout differs for A vs B.** The
`wmmaDotOperandToLinearLayout` body is the same for both opIdx,
but `dimK` and `dimNonK` swap positions based on `getOpIdx()`.
Observed on matmul_fp16 with `kWidth=16`, `depth=2`, `nonKDim=16`:

  Operand A (v170-177, ha):
    lane L, register r → A[M = L%16,
                           K = (r & 7) + 16*((r>>3)&1) + 8*((L>>4)&1)]
  — lane bit 4 shifts K by 8 (the doc's "depth offsets K"
  interpretation); register bit 3 shifts K by 16 (the "kWidth"
  offset that makes register 8..15 span the upper K half).

  Operand B PRE-swap (v186-193 pre-v_permlane16_swap):
    lane L, register r → B[N = L%16 + 16*((L>>4)&1),
                           K = (r & 7) + 16*((r>>3)&1)]
  — lane bit 4 shifts **N** by 16 (not K); register bit 3 shifts
  K by 16.  So A's and B's per-lane layouts are NOT mirror
  images — they diverge at the lane-bit-4 contribution.

**Fact 3 — POST-swap v186-193 holds HALF of K, not full.** The
`v_permlane16_swap_b32 v186, v194` cross-wires (lanes 0-15 v186)
↔ (lanes 16-31 v194) and vice-versa, leaving post-swap v186-193
with only the K subset that pre-swap v194-201 held (K ∈ {8-15,
24-31}).  The other K subset (K ∈ {0-7, 16-23}) stays in
post-swap v194-201.  Combined across the four WMMA calls:

  * WMMA1 (A=v186, B=v170): K={8-15, 24-31} partial product.
  * WMMA2 (A=v194, B=v170): K={0-7, 16-23} partial product.
  * WMMA3 (A=v186, B=v178): K={8-15, 24-31} partial product.
  * WMMA4 (A=v194, B=v178): K={0-7, 16-23} partial product.

**The structural barrier.** Given only 8 VGPRs (v186-193) enter
the WMMA.A operand slot per call, and those 8 VGPRs hold only
half of K, a per-WMMA-independent MFMA lowering CANNOT reconstruct
the full K sum from a single WMMA intrinsic call's data — the
missing K data lives in a sibling register range (v194-201) that
the single-intrinsic lowering model doesn't see.  The four
accumulators (v[2:9], v[10:17], v[18:25], v[26:33]) go to
different output regions in Triton's epilogue, so the
"WMMA1+WMMA2 go to the same sub-tile accumulator" collapse that
would let the MFMA lowering stay per-WMMA doesn't happen either.

**Paths forward, in order of how principled they are:**

  1. **Raiser-level 4-WMMA-pattern recognition (principled,
     expensive).**  Teach `raiser.cpp` to detect the quad-WMMA
     fragment-shuffle idiom (= `v_permlane16_swap_b32` → 4 back-
     to-back WMMAs sharing operand register ranges) and emit a
     single `<32 x half>` A operand tensor into the WMMA
     lowering.  The MFMA redistribution then has access to both
     K halves (v186-v201 combined) and can produce the full K
     sum.  Requires a new pre-raise phase and a second WMMA
     intrinsic variant that consumes 16 VGPRs per-lane A; non-
     trivial and touches the lift structure beyond `wmma_lowering.cpp`.

  2. **Pre-swap instrumentation + raise the PRE-swap vregs
     instead (cheaper, loses register-reuse).** Re-lift the four
     WMMA calls to consume PRE-permlane16_swap register ranges
     (v186-193 pre-swap has the standard DotOperand layout that
     `redistributeInput` already handles correctly).  This would
     keep the lowering mostly unchanged but loses the register
     coalescing Triton's post-swap gets, and requires the
     `v_permlane16_swap_b32` lift to not-destructively rewrite
     the post-swap vregs.

  3. **Decode gfx1250 WMMA.A ISA layout from hardware (ideal,
     needs ISA-spec access).**  If the AMD gfx1250 ISA spec
     documents the exact per-lane (M, K) ↔ (lane, register)
     mapping for `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16`, we can write the
     correct post-swap `redistributeInput_A` that accounts for
     the layout asymmetry and skips the 16-VGPR raiser change.
     Not currently accessible from our side.

Session 7 verified empirically that my Session-5 `redistributeInput`
swap (LG1/LG2 interchange) IS correct for operand A (mode 7 /
mode 9 confirm) but INCORRECT for operand B under the post-swap
layout above — because the single-register-set assumption breaks
down.  The experimental fix was reverted.  The narrowed refusal
gate from §12.4.5 remains the principled outcome.

### 12.4.7 Session-8 root cause pinned (2026-04-23)

Session 7 concluded the raiser-level layout work was blocked on
ISA decoding that wasn't accessible.  The user then made MI400
Shader Programming Guide excerpts available via
`hotswap/docs/manuals/`, and the § V_PERMLANE16_SWAP_B32 pragma
showed the root cause was NOT in `wmma_lowering.cpp` /
`redistributeInput` at all — it was one layer up, in the
`v_permlane16_swap_b32` lift itself (`handle_valu_cross_lane.cpp`
`emitPermLaneSwapEmulation`).

The ISA semantic is **asymmetric**: only lanes 0..15 of `src0`
get swapped with lanes 16..31 of `vdst`; lanes 16..31 of `src0`
and lanes 0..15 of `vdst` are **unchanged**.  The pragma pins it
verbatim:

```
// Lanes 0:15 of src0 and lanes 16:31 of vdst swapped.
// Lanes 16:31 of src0 and lanes 0:15 of vdst are unchanged.
for lane in 0:15 do tmp[lane] = VGPR[lane][SRC0] endfor;
for lane in 0:15 do
  if EXEC[lane]:    VGPR[lane][SRC0]  = VGPR[lane+16][VDST]
  if EXEC[lane+16]: VGPR[lane+16][VDST] = tmp[lane]
endfor
```

Our pre-Session-8 emulation was **symmetric** — two cross-wired
`ds_bpermute` calls that unconditionally swapped both 16-lane
halves via `lane XOR 16`:

```
new_vdst     = bpermute(addr, src0)   // all lanes swap
new_src0_out = bpermute(addr, vdst)   // all lanes swap
```

That over-swapped the two halves that the ISA says are
UNCHANGED, corrupting every `matmul_fp16` input position and
surfacing downstream as the `+16 col shift` / `+4 bias`
residuals that Sessions 5–7 characterised at the MFMA-
redistribution layer.  The `redistributeInput` asymmetries those
sessions documented are **not** the root cause — they are
correct relative to a correct upstream swap.

**The fix** (see `handle_valu_cross_lane.cpp::
emitPermLaneSwapEmulation`): compute both partner bpermutes,
then per-lane `select` on the half-bit `lane AND partnerXorMask`
to match the ISA's asymmetric per-half semantic:

```
isLaneLow    = (lane & partnerXorMask) == 0
new_vdst     = select(isLaneLow, vdst_in,        bperm_src0)
new_src0_out = select(isLaneLow, bperm_vdst,     src0_in)
```

**Source-ISA gate (`ctx.isa.isWave32()`).** The asymmetric
pragma excerpted above is from the MI400 Shader Programming
Guide, which covers gfx1250 (the only wave32 ISA that exposes
both `v_permlane16_swap_b32` and `v_permlane32_swap_b32`).
gfx950 also exposes `v_permlane16_swap_b32`, but we do not
currently have its ISA pragma in hand to confirm whether the
wave64 flavour mirrors the asymmetric semantic or is genuinely
symmetric per 32-lane half.  The fix therefore gates the new
per-lane select shape behind `ctx.isa.isWave32()`: gfx1250
sources take the asymmetric path, gfx950 sources keep the
pre-Session-8 symmetric bpermute cross-wire.  The existing
`v_permlane32_swap_b32` and `c2_permlane_swap` lit fixtures
(the latter tightened in this commit to pin the asymmetric
shape on gfx1250 source) cover the two arms.  If a future
gfx950→gfx942 regression surfaces that points at the symmetric
arm, confirm the gfx950 pragma via `docs/manuals/` and
either (a) extend the gate to the wave64 arm or (b) leave the
symmetric shape in place, depending on the pragma text.

**Transitional rewrite passes.** Two transitional rewrites
(`rewrite_permlane16_xor3_partner`,
`rewrite_permlane16_swap_selfpreserve`) were introduced on
earlier commits to paper over the symmetric emulation for the
Triton `tl.sort` / `tl.topk` cross-16 bitonic-merge idiom.
Under the correct asymmetric semantic the downstream xor3
composition already produces `partner_seed` through standard
arithmetic (Triton's idiom was designed for the asymmetric
semantic in the first place), so both passes are now obsolete:
the xor3-partner pass's IR fingerprint (direct `xor(bpermute,
bpermute)`) no longer matches because the bpermutes feed
`select`s, and the selfpreserve pass's blanket `RAUW →
seedRoot` actively corrupts the asymmetric select's partner-
half output.  Defaults have been flipped to **off** for both;
the raise_cli opt-in flags (`--enable-permlane16-xor3-partner`
and `--enable-permlane16-swap-selfpreserve`) are retained for
audit / bisection only.

**Empirical verification** (post-fix):

| Recipe                                     | Pre-fix        | Post-fix |

| `canary_tl_sort_fp32_n16` (random input)   | WRONG 1056/8192 | WRONG 1056/8192 (open; orthogonal to the cross-16 fix) |
| deterministic `canary_tl_sort_fp32_n16_*` variants | match | match |
| `canary_tl_topk_{bf16,fp32}`               | 2/2 match      | 2/2 match |
| `canary_pairsort1_fp32_n16_nw2_r32`        | 1/1 match      | 1/1 match |

The WMMA refusal gates in `handle_valu_vop3p.cpp` (Sessions 5/6
K=4, K=32/K=64 MODREP with `kernelHasPermlane16Swap`) are
**dropped** — the MODREP MFMA redistribution is now correct for
both single-WMMA (`matmul_fp16_16x16`) and multi-WMMA
(`matmul_fp16`) regimes.  The `kernelHasPermlane16Swap` pre-scan
infrastructure (`raise_context.hpp`, `raiser.cpp`) is retained as
it's unscoped to this fix — any future cross-WMMA diagnostic
that wants to detect the multi-WMMA pattern can reuse it.

Regression guards landed with the fix:

* `lit_tests/c2_permlane_swap/` — tightened to pin the ASYMMETRIC
  shape on gfx1250 source (half-bit AND + icmp + two per-lane
  selects feeding the final `new_vdst` / `new_src0_out` VGPRs).
* `lit_tests/v_permlane32_swap_b32/` — left pinned to the
  SYMMETRIC shape since the gate keeps gfx950 source on the
  pre-Session-8 arm.
* `lit_tests/wmma_f32_16x16x4_f32/wmma_f32_16x16x4_f32_modrep.ll`
  — closes the coverage gap on the K=4 WMMA MODREP path (the
  old refusal gate that was dropped for this commit had no
  corpus-level test keeping it honest).
* Permlane16-swap regression coverage pins the asymmetric expectations
  for same-wave, ModuloReplication, and WaveNative projection modes.
* Divergent-EXEC permlane16-swap coverage pins the per-destination-lane
  EXEC gate: inactive lanes must retain their initial VGPR values while
  active lanes see the asymmetric swap.

## 13. Relationship to other axes

- **SPE / wave-size** (`wave-size-translation.md`): WMMA sites require uniform
  reachability (G3). The two-pass lowering is itself the
  SPE-compatible decomposition — it runs both wave32 replicas of the
  source fragment independently, which is exactly the modulo-
  replication projection SPE uses.
- **Async copy / tensor data movement:** MFMA operands arrive through
  LDS in most GEMMs. Descriptor-driven LDS filling is a predecessor
  concern; matrix translation assumes the operands are in VGPRs at
  the moment of the MFMA call, however they got there.
- **Sync** (`sync-translation.md`): No matrix-specific sync concerns.
  The accumulator chain across a K-loop is an IR-level dataflow
  dependence; the backend emits the needed waitcnt.
- **ABI** (`abi-translation.md`): AGPR vs VGPR-only accumulator is
  declared at ABI level. The raiser emits VGPR accumulators; target
  backend's AGPR allocator is allowed to move them.
- **Cross-cutting capability dispatch:** §5.0 is the matrix-axis
  instance of the project-wide "emit native when the target supports
  it, decompose only when it does not" principle. See
  `target-capability-dispatch.md` for the shared design and the
  open implementation question (does LLVM already expose per-SemOp
  feature requirements we can reuse for the registration table?).
