## 1. Problem in one paragraph

The translator's output is an LLVM IR module that the stock AMDGPU
backend compiles and hands to the HSA runtime as a fresh code object.
That code object has its own kernel descriptor (KD), its own kernarg
layout, and its own user-SGPR preloaded values — all re-synthesised by
the target backend from IR-level attributes. What it must agree with
is **the host runtime's call site**: the kernarg buffer the dispatch
packet points at, the grid and workgroup dimensions the user code
supplied, and the set of implicit arguments the HSA runtime injects.
The host is still asking for the gfx1250 kernel. The target KD has to
make the gfx950 binary answer the same question. Any field the source
kernel *reads* that the target KD cannot *populate identically* is an
ABI hole, and today we have no gate for it — the kernel runs and
silently reads garbage.

## 2. What "translation" actually means on this axis

There are three distinct surfaces, each handled differently:

| Surface | Source state | Target synthesis | Translation mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kernel descriptor (64-byte AMDHSA KD) | Parsed from `.note` / `.rodata` during load | Re-emitted by target backend from IR attrs | **Attribute-preserving lower-to-IR** |
| Kernarg segment | Host-side layout, shared by both ISAs | Same — unchanged | **Layout-preserving** (but hidden-arg slots shift) |
| Embedded descriptors (V#, T#) | Rare; constructed at runtime from kernargs | Same — runtime-constructed | **Pass-through** (principle); refuse on embedded constant V# |

The first two are where the real work lives. §4 and §5 cover them.
The third is included for completeness: it is a gate, not a rewrite.

## 3. Source model — gfx1250 (gfx12) AMDHSA KD and kernarg

### 3.1 Kernel descriptor fields the raiser cares about

Of the ~20 bitfields in the gfx1250 KD, only these five affect
correctness of the raised IR (the rest are scheduling/occupancy hints
the target backend re-derives):

- `enable_wavefront_size32` — always set on gfx1250. Tells the raiser
  the source was compiled as wave32.
- `group_segment_fixed_size` — LDS bytes. Must be ≤ gfx950 limit
  (163,840 B) for the kernel to fit at all.
- `private_segment_fixed_size` — scratch bytes per lane. Implicitly
  doubles on wave64 since twice as many lanes are live; the target
  backend derives this automatically *if* we propagate the original
  per-lane value as an attribute.
- `kernarg_size` — total kernarg bytes. Passed as
  `meta.kernargSegmentSize` and must be preserved bit-exactly (the
  host runtime's dispatch packet carries this size).
- `enable_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr` / the user-SGPR preload bits —
  determine which user SGPRs carry which implicit pointers (kernarg
  base, dispatch packet, queue ptr, …). gfx12 and gfx9 have different
  user-SGPR layouts. See §3.3.

Everything else (VGPR/SGPR granulated counts, register usage modes,
occupancy hints, round-mode bits) is a target-backend output, not a
translation input.

### 3.2 Kernarg layout

The kernarg segment is a flat byte buffer. The host-side layout is
the same across ISAs, modulo alignment. The hitch is that the kernel
reads it via `s_load_*` with small displacements that the raiser has
to resolve back to IR-level arguments — `KernargLayout::resolveLoad`
in `kernarg_layout.hpp:21`. That resolution is already ISA-agnostic.

### 3.3 Hidden arguments

gfx12 Triton kernels commonly consume these hidden args (names from
the AMDHSA metadata):

- `hidden_block_count_{x,y,z}`
- `hidden_group_size_{x,y,z}`
- `hidden_remainder_{x,y,z}`
- `hidden_grid_dims`
- `hidden_private_base`, `hidden_shared_base`
- `hidden_global_offset_{x,y,z}` (legacy, rarely used)
- `hidden_default_queue`, `hidden_completion_action`,
  `hidden_multigrid_sync_arg`, `hidden_hostcall_buffer`,
  `hidden_heap_v1`

The current raiser skips every `hidden_*` arg when building the
function signature (`raiser.cpp:201-205`). That is correct for
kernels that never load from them. The moment a kernel reads any
hidden slot, we silently return zero — because the allocated kernarg
bytes are still there, but the IR has no formal parameter covering
them. This is the first principled gate we need (§7).

### 3.4 User-SGPR preload layout

gfx12 preloads user SGPRs starting at a different base than gfx9 and
with a different enable-bit encoding. `raiser.cpp:279-292` already
handles this:

```263:292:amd/comgr/hotswap/raiser.cpp
  regs.storeSGPR32(B, 2, B.CreateCall(fnWorkgroupIdX, {}, "wg_id_x"));
  // ...
  if (AMDGPU::isGFX12Plus(*mc.subtargetInfo)) {
    B.CreateStore(B.CreateCall(fnWorkgroupIdX, {}, "ttmp9_wg_id"), regs.ttmp[9]);
    // wave_id = workitem_id_x / wavefront_size (32 for gfx12)
    Value *tidForTtmp = B.CreateCall(fnWorkitemIdX, {}, "ttmp8_tid");
    Value *waveId = B.CreateLShr(tidForTtmp, B.getInt32(5), "wave_id_in_wg");
    Value *ttmp8Val = B.CreateShl(waveId, B.getInt32(25), "ttmp8_val");
    B.CreateStore(ttmp8Val, regs.ttmp[8]);
  }
```

The gfx12-vs-gfx9 user-SGPR divergence is thus already absorbed at the
*read* side. The *target KD* side (telling gfx950's KD which user SGPR
carries workgroup_id_x) is the backend's job once the IR calls the
right intrinsic. This already works.

## 4. Target model — gfx950 AMDHSA KD re-emission

### 4.0 Target-capability dispatch (KD and kernarg-slot level)

The ABI axis participates in the same project-wide
"emit native when the target supports it, decompose / synthesise only
when it does not" principle as matrix (§5.0), async / tensor-copy, and sync
(§5.0). It is subtler here because "native emit" for ABI means "the
target backend re-synthesises the KD from IR attributes" rather than
"the handler emits a specific LLVM intrinsic". What varies by target
are the user-SGPR layout, the hidden-arg block contents, and the
`enable_wavefront_size*` bit — each of which has a capability branch.

#### 4.0.1 Capability bits

Extend `ISAProfile` with:

| New / existing bit | Backing feature | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `waveSize` (existing) | `FeatureWavefrontSize32` | `enable_wavefront_size32` synthesis |
| `hasGFX12UserSGPRLayout` | `AMDGPU::isGFX12Plus(STI)` (existing helper) | ttmp preload init (`raiser.cpp:284-292`) |
| `hasFlatScratchArchitected` | `FeatureArchitectedFlatScratch` | interprets `hidden_private_base` |
| `hasFlatLDSArchitected` | `FeatureArchitectedSGPRs` + flat-LDS bit | interprets `hidden_shared_base` |
| `maxGroupSegmentSize` (existing profile field) | per-ISA constant | G1 LDS-budget gate |

These are not "emit vs. decompose" in the matrix sense — they select
between **attribute values** the backend consumes, not between
handler paths. Same mechanism, different granularity.

#### 4.0.2 Dispatch pattern

The source-side read of user SGPRs already dispatches on one of these
bits — `raiser.cpp:284-292`:

```cpp
if (AMDGPU::isGFX12Plus(*mc.subtargetInfo)) {
  // gfx12 ttmp preload layout
} else {
  // gfx9/10/11 layout
}
```

Promote the feature query to the `ISAProfile` field above so the same
pattern generalises to every axis without re-reading the subtarget
info:

```cpp
if (ctx.sourceIsa.hasGFX12UserSGPRLayout) {
  initGFX12TtmpPreload(ctx);
} else {
  initLegacyTtmpPreload(ctx);
}
```

Hidden-arg resolution (§5) then layers on the second branch: for each
slot, look up the `(sourceIsa, targetIsa)` cell in the compatibility
table to decide identity/derivable/host-inject/refuse.

#### 4.0.3 Consequences for same-family retarget

gfx1251 → gfx1250 is an identity on every capability bit in §4.0.1.
The KD re-emission is bit-identical to the source (modulo backend-
rederived fields like register counts), every hidden arg maps
"identity", and no gate fires. This is why the same-family path
collapses to "raise to IR, lower to target" with no ABI-specific
work — the capability branches above all take the identity path.

### 4.1 What the backend gives us for free

Emitting IR with `CallingConv::AMDGPU_KERNEL`, plus:

- Formal parameters typed by the raised kernarg layout
- Intrinsic calls for `workgroup_id_*`, `workitem_id_*`, dispatch
  packet pointer, queue pointer, etc.
- `"amdgpu-flat-work-group-size"` attribute pinned to the source's
  declared size (`raiser.cpp:231-232`)

…is sufficient for the gfx950 backend to synthesise a valid KD whose
user-SGPR layout, VGPR/SGPR granulated counts, LDS size, and wave64
enable bits are all self-consistent.

### 4.2 What the backend cannot infer

Two inputs only the raiser has access to:

1. **Original per-lane scratch size.** The backend allocates scratch
   from observed spills in the lowered target function. If the source
   kernel declared scratch the backend doesn't re-derive (e.g.,
   dynamic stack-like scratch allocated via `hidden_private_base`),
   we must propagate `meta.privateSegmentFixedSize` as an attribute.
2. **LDS size commitment.** The source declared a fixed LDS size; the
   target emission must at least match it (and can be larger). The
   `"amdgpu-lds-size"` / `addr-space-cast` approach ties this up at
   IR level — TODO below.

### 4.2.1 Scratch/private-memory translation

`scratch_*` instructions are not global-memory operations with a special
base register. They are accesses to the source kernel's per-work-item
private segment: the hardware swizzles the dword offset by lane and adds
the wave's launch-time scratch base. The launch-time allocation is requested
by the KD's `private_segment_fixed_size` plus
`compute_pgm_rsrc2.ENABLE_PRIVATE_SEGMENT`; on gfx12 the source KD may also
request `enable_sgpr_flat_scratch_init`, while gfx9/gfx942 target codegen for
LLVM private memory normally emits scratch opcodes with
`.amdhsa_enable_private_segment 1` rather than a user-SGPR flat-scratch pair.

Hotswap models this at the ABI layer by creating one addrspace(5) private
frame for the source private segment, sized from the parsed source KD. A
translated `scratch_load/store` becomes a load/store through a GEP inside
that frame. This deliberately lets the target AMDGPU backend lay the source
private frame out together with any target spills and emit the target KD's
private-segment fields. Hotswap refuses a `scratch_*` instruction when the
source KD reports `private_segment_fixed_size == 0`, because inventing
scratch backing would change the source launch ABI instead of translating it.

### 4.3 What changes at ISA boundary

| Source (gfx1250) | Target (gfx950) | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_wavefront_size32=1` | Must be wave64 | Clear bit; emit via `CallingConv::AMDGPU_KERNEL` on wave64 subtarget — backend does the right thing |
| gfx12 user-SGPR slots for `workgroup_id_x` | gfx9 slots | Abstracted at intrinsic level; see §3.4 |
| `private_segment_size` at 32-lane wave | At 64-lane wave | Backend re-derives; we propagate via attribute |
| `group_segment_size` ≤ 327,680 | Limit 163,840 | **Refuse** if source > 163,840 (§7) |
| `kernarg_size` arbitrary | Same bit-for-bit | Preserve via `KernargLayout` |
| gfx12 hidden-arg block | gfx9 hidden-arg block | **Per-arg compatibility table** (§5) |

## 5. Hidden argument compatibility table

Each hidden arg is one of:

- **identity** — present on both ISAs with identical meaning; reads
  pass through unchanged.
- **derivable** — not present in target kernarg, but the value is
  computable from other available state; raiser synthesises it.
- **host-inject** — present on target kernarg, but at a different
  offset; raiser re-maps the load.
- **refuse** — meaningful on source, no equivalent on target; the
  kernel uses a capability we cannot provide.

| Hidden arg | gfx1250 | gfx950 | Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hidden_block_count_{x,y,z}` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_group_size_{x,y,z}` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_remainder_{x,y,z}` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_grid_dims` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_global_offset_{x,y,z}` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_private_base` | present (gfx12 flat-scratch base) | N/A on buffer scratch | derivable — 0 on gfx950 |
| `hidden_shared_base` | present (gfx12 flat-LDS base) | N/A | derivable — 0 on gfx950 |
| `hidden_default_queue` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_completion_action` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_multigrid_sync_arg` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_hostcall_buffer` | present | present | identity |
| `hidden_heap_v1` | present | present | identity |

No **refuse** entries in the current table. The two **derivable**
entries (`hidden_private_base`, `hidden_shared_base`) exist because
gfx1250 uses architected flat scratch / flat-LDS addressing spaces
with non-zero base addresses; on gfx950 the per-kernel scratch goes
through a buffer descriptor (the "flat scratch" path compiles down
to V# ops) and private_base is effectively zero.

The raiser replaces reads of these slots with a constant `i64 0`. If
the kernel *writes* to them (it shouldn't — they're consumed from the
kernarg-backed hidden block, not written), that is a refusal case.

## 6. Embedded descriptors

### 6.1 Buffer descriptors (V#) in .rodata

V# format changed encoding between gfx11 and gfx12. Triton and
Tensilelite kernels construct V#s at runtime from kernargs — the V#
bits are never stored as a constant in `.rodata`. We have not observed
any embedded-constant V# in the 170-kernel corpus.

**Gate:** scan `.rodata` for 128-bit-aligned values whose bits 58..63
match a known DFMT/NFMT pattern; if found, refuse. This is a
false-positive-prone heuristic, so the gate fires only when we *also*
observe a `s_load_b128` reading that address in the raised IR.

### 6.2 Runtime-constructed V# — no translation required

The kernel assembles a V# from base+size+stride+format bits via
`s_mov_b32` / `s_lshl_b64` / `s_or_b32`. The target backend re-lowers
`buffer_load_dword` on gfx950's V# format bit layout, using whatever
the source code computed. The format-code field is the only hazard:

- gfx9 DFMT/NFMT are a (4-bit, 3-bit) split in bits [53..59].
- gfx12 folded these into a larger `OOB_SELECT` + `FORMAT` at bit [53..62].

If the source code constructs a V# with a format code that is valid
on gfx12 but meaningless on gfx9 (e.g., `FORMAT = 0x40` indicating
structured buffer), the `buffer_load` on gfx950 will return garbage.

**Gate at the VALU handler:** when the V#'s format-computing
instructions fold to a constant, the raiser flags unrecognised codes
and refuses. When the format is dynamic, emit a runtime assert on
first use (optional; off by default).

### 6.3 Image descriptors (T#)

Not used by any captured corpus kernel. Treat as refusal until a real
case appears. The scan in §6.1 extends naturally.

## 7. Principled fail-loudly gates

All gates run at raise time, before any target lowering. Each gate's
failure yields a `RaiseFailure` with a distinct reason code so the
loader's rejection report is actionable.

### G1 — LDS budget (startup on the target subtarget)

```
if (meta.groupSegmentFixedSize > targetIsa.maxGroupSegmentSize)
  return RaiseFailure::ldsOverBudget(meta.groupSegmentFixedSize,
                                     targetIsa.maxGroupSegmentSize);
```

### G2 — Hidden-arg coverage (per-kernel at raise)

For every `s_load_*` whose resolved kernarg offset lands in the
implicit-args block (`offset ≥ kernargs.implicitArgsBase`), identify
which named hidden arg it reads. If the arg is not in the source's
declared `meta.args` (Triton sometimes reads past its own declared
args), refuse. If the arg maps to a **refuse** row in §5, refuse. If
it maps to a **derivable** row, substitute the IR constant.

### G3 — User-SGPR compatibility (startup)

For each user-SGPR enable bit the source KD sets, verify the target
ISA supports the same intrinsic (e.g., `llvm.amdgcn.dispatch.ptr`
exists across all AMDGPU subtargets, but
`llvm.amdgcn.implicit.buffer.ptr` is a gfx<11 artefact). Startup
verification over a fixed mapping table.

### G4 — Embedded descriptor refusal (per-kernel)

§6.1 scan; refuse on any hit.

### G5 — Kernarg alignment (per-kernel)

For each argument, verify `byteOffset % byteSize == 0`. The host
runtime pads to this anyway; a mismatch means the source metadata
is wrong, and the kernel would have UB already on gfx1250 — refuse
rather than inherit the bug.

## 8. Decision procedure (per kernel)

```
raise(bytes, source_isa, target_isa, meta):
  run G1, G3 at startup (once per (source_isa, target_isa) pair)
  for each kernel:
    run G5 immediately
    raise to IR, interleaving G2 at each kernarg-load resolution
    post-raise: run G4
    if any gate fires: return RaiseFailure
    else: emit IR; backend synthesises target KD from attrs + IR
```

No partial accepts. No "best effort" hidden-arg reads. If the kernel
reaches anything ambiguous, we reject it loudly.

## 9. What this doc does *not* cover

- **Flat-scratch → buffer-scratch lowering.** That is a memory-ops
  concern, folded into the existing `handleFLAT` handler (gfx9 buffer
  scratch is the native flat-addrspace lowering on CDNA). The SemOps
  for flat/global/scratch loads already exist (`semop.hpp:157-166`);
  cross-ISA flat-scratch→V# rewrite happens at the handler level, not
  at ABI level.
- **VGPR/SGPR count inflation.** The target backend owns this. If IR
  spills past target register budget, that is a target-backend
  failure (compile-time error), not an ABI concern.
- **Occupancy hints.** Intentionally not pinned (`raiser.cpp:234-241`
  documents why). Performance, not correctness.

## 10. Engineering tasks

In dependency order, cheapest first.

### T1 — Add `meta.groupSegmentFixedSize` plumbing + G1

One struct field, one check in `raiseToIR` before Phase 2. 30 LoC.

### T2 — Hidden-arg compatibility table + G2

- `hidden_args_table.hpp` — static constexpr array keyed on
  (arg_name, source_isa, target_isa) producing an enum
  `{Identity, Derivable(constant), HostInject(remap), Refuse}`.
- Extend `KernargLayout::resolveLoad` to return a hidden-arg handle
  when the resolved offset is in the implicit block.
- Raiser consults the table at each resolution; emits constant or
  `RaiseFailure::hiddenArgUnsupported`.

~150 LoC + table maintenance. The table is data, not code.

### T3 — Embedded-descriptor scan (G4)

Post-raise pass over the IR walking `.rodata`-backed constants;
reject on format-code anomalies. ~80 LoC.

### T4 — Scratch/private-segment propagation

Forward `meta.privateSegmentFixedSize` into `RaiseContext` and model real
`scratch_*` instructions as addrspace(5) private-frame accesses. The target
backend then emits the target KD's private segment request; unsupported
subcases refuse with source KD scratch fields in the structured diagnostic.

### T5 — User-SGPR compatibility table + G3

Table of (enable-bit, available-intrinsic) × (source_isa, target_isa).
Startup check against both subtargets. ~60 LoC.

## 11. Open design questions

1. **Where does the source KD live post-load?** Currently the loader
   parses `meta.*` from the ELF note block. Do we also need the raw
   64-byte KD bytes as input to the gates, or is the parsed `meta` a
   sufficient model? Current answer: parsed `meta` is sufficient
   because every field in §3.1 is already surfaced there. The raw KD
   is discarded.
2. **Hostcall and multigrid-sync on cross-ISA translation.** Identity
   entries in §5 assume the hostcall ABI is ISA-stable. If a future
   runtime bumps the hostcall format between gfx1250 and gfx950, the
   table grows a new class: `host-incompatible` (refuse). No action
   today.
3. **Embedded V# detection false positives.** §6.1's scan is a
   heuristic. If it turns out to produce spurious refusals on any
   real kernel, move the check to first-use of the constant by a V#
   consumer (so we only flag V#s we can prove are V#s). This is a
   straightforward refinement; today's corpus has no constants
   matching the pattern at all, so we ship §6.1 as-is.
4. **Multi-target from one source.** If the same gfx1250 binary will
   be retargeted to *both* gfx942 and gfx950 in the same process, do
   the gates need per-target caching? Today the raiser runs per
   (source, target) pair, so the gates run fresh each time. No
   correctness impact; a later optimisation if needed.

## 12. Cross-axis relationship — capability dispatch

§4.0 is the ABI-axis instance of the project-wide "emit native when
the target supports it, synthesise only when it does not" principle.
See `target-capability-dispatch.md` for the shared design and the
open implementation question (does LLVM already expose per-feature /
per-intrinsic availability we can reuse for the hidden-arg and
user-SGPR compatibility tables?).
